I found these Russian surplus Vacuum Florescent Displays on EBAY.
Many of the electronic toys I had in the 70's and early 80's had VFD diplays in them.
LEDs and LCD displays simply don't have the cool glow of a VFD. Of course, there's a huge nostalgia kick for me.

I've never designed anything using a VFD so I decided to read up on them and build a clock.
This is a simple clock design with the VFD as the clock display, three buttons (brightness, clock up, clock down), and a PIR to detect if someone's in the room.
The clock's display turns off when the PIR doesn't detect a person (or animal) in the vicinity.
